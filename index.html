                <h2 id="">Seven facts you probably didn't know about Helen Keller</h2>
                <p id="facts-intro"> Helen Keller is much more than a name or a symbol. She was a woman of astounding
                    intelligence, unwavering determination, unbelievable courage and insurmountable achievement.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>She was the first person with deafblindness to earn a college degree. From Radcliffe, no less,
                        from which she graduated cum laude in 1904 with a Bachelor’s Degree.</li>
                    <li>She was great friends with Mark Twain. The two met when Keller was 14, and remained friends
                        until Twain died 16 years later. He admired her sense of humor and sharp intelligence. Twain, in
                        fact, was the first to call Sullivan a “miracle worker” for bringing Keller out of the darkness.
                        When they met in person, Keller was able to identify Twain by his distinctive tobacco-infused
                        scent – he smoked 10 to 20 cigars a day.</li>
                    <li>She worked the vaudeville circuit. In 1920, Keller and Sullivan began a five-year stint in
                        vaudeville to supplement their dwindling finances. Touted as the “8th Wonder of the World,”
                        Keller performed a 20-minute show, where she told her life story in her own words (translated by
                        Sullivan). Q&A sessions with the audience allowed Keller to demonstrate her intelligence and
                        sense of humor. For example, shortly after Prohibition became the law of the land, she was asked
                        by an audience member, “What do you think is the most important question before the country
                        today?” Keller’s response: “How to get a drink.” She left the vaudeville circuit after
                        Sullivan’s health declined too much for them to continue.</li>
                    <li>She was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in 1953. The nomination came after Keller visited the
                        Mideast in 1952 and met with local leaders to advocate for the rights of those who were blind or
                        disabled. She secured a promise from Egypt’s Minister of Education to create secondary schools
                        for the blind that could lead to a college education. The legacy of her visit still lives on at
                        the Hellen Keller School in Jerusalem, Israel.</li>
                    <li>She was extremely political. In addition to being a member of the Socialist Party, Keller was a
                        founder of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). She was an outspoken advocate for women’s
                        rights and a strong supporter of birth control, all radical views for a woman in the early 20th
                        century.</li>
                    <li>She fell in love and almost eloped. Keller was in her late 30s when Sullivan fell suddenly ill.
                        Keller brought in a private secretary named Peter Fagan, with whom she fell in love and planned
                        to elope. But her family strongly objected because they believed that women with disabilities
                        should not marry, ultimately thwarting the couple’s plans.</li>
                    <li>She remains influential and respected even after her death. In 1999 her name appeared on Time
                        magazine’s list of the 100 most important figures of the 20th century, alongside such iconic
                        figures as Albert Einstein, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi. That’s an impressive
                        accomplishment for anyone, and more so for a woman who couldn’t see or hear.</li>
